  Components Overview

    JSX: 

    props: 
      the essential information needed to create a component for displaying the information

    proptypes:
      specifying the type of the props values needed to create a component
      this helps in reducing unwanted errors because of typeerror
  
  Styles and Module styles
    inline style --> using it as object
      HTML Inline
        <img src='https://image.com/image.png' style="height: 200px; width: 100px" />
      React Inline
        <img src={props.imageUrl} style={{ height: '200px', width: '100px' }} />

    External Styling:
      normal styling using .css
      module styling using .module.css
        import styles from './movie.module.css';
        module styling only classNames and tags are allowed

  Working with array lists
      List Rendering

  Usage of keys:
      key props for a component is used to identify an element uniquely by VDOM
      Do not use array index for key in component that will lead to confusion during interactions ( CRUD Operations )

    ToDoList:
      1. Eat 
      2. Sleep
      3. Code
      4. Dance
    
    if we use index as key, during crud operations the VDOM gets confused beacuse the indexing

      Example: 
        just deleting an element with key 1

        will make the index of 2 sit in the index of 1 now, because of the modifications in the array

  Events in react
    always use a named callback function

    conditional rendering:  
        {<boolean-value-evaluation> && ( JSX Element )}
        {<boolean-value-evaluation> ? (this JSX Element) : (that JSX Element)}


Task:

  Day 21: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mqZqoxmPlEioKCwVfuOYIUcG2kESrYuocrYO4h9kiRk/edit

  Start the Task by creating the UI in the site https://startbootstrap.com/previews/shop-homepage


Next Session:
  
  DOM Loading / rendering of JSX elements
      
  State --> is value in the rendered JSX that changes during any events
      
      Pimary in React:

        ****** Do Not Touch Document Object in React ******

        it is CRIME if You do so
      
      rendering & re-rendering parts of react

        Normal JSX Syntax will render only once without any state hooks

      Hooks:
        Hooking setup between the memory of the JS and JSX Element

        when a memory of JS changes( Hook memory value ), JSX automatically re-renders

  Stateful & stateless component

      Stateful component is component which has a state value which changes

      Stateless -> Component which does not have a state value rather have only static values

      Props ---> static values passed during rendering
      State --> a value changes causing the re-rendering
